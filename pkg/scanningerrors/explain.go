	licenseIssue: `This probably means that you added or upgraded a dependency, and the
		automated opensource-license-checker objects to what it sees.  This may because of a
		bug in the checker (github.com/datawire/go-mkopensource) that you need to go fix, or
		it may be because of an actual license issue that prevents you from being allowed to
		use a package, and you need to find an alternative.`,

	licenseDetection: `This probably means that you added or upgraded a dependency, and the
		automated opensource-license-checker can't confidently detect what the license is.
		(This is a good thing, because it is reminding you to check the license of libraries
		before using them.)

		Some possible causes for  this issue are:

		- Dependency is proprietary Ambassador Labs software: Create a yaml file with the proprietary 
          dependencies and pass it to the generate.sh script using the --proprietary-packages command line option.
          See the README.md file for more information.

		- License information can't be identified: Add an entry to 
          hardcodedGoDependencies, hardcodedPythonDependencies 
          or hardcodedJsDependencies depending on the dependency that
          was not identified.`,

	internalUsageOnly: `To solve this error, replace the dependency with another that uses an acceptable license.

        Refer to https://www.notion.so/datawire/License-Management-5194ca50c9684ff4b301143806c92157#1cd50aeeafa7456bba24c761c0a2d173

	licenseForbidden: `To solve this error, replace the dependency with another that uses an acceptable license.
