3 license-approval errors:
 1. package "example.com/apache-patent/a": the Apache license contains a patent-grant, but there's a separate PATENTS file; something hokey is going on
 2. package "example.com/apache-patent/b": the Apache license contains a patent-grant, but there's a separate PATENTS file; something hokey is going on
 3. package "example.com/cc-sa": has an unacceptable license for use by Ambassador Labs (Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International)
    This probably means that you added or upgraded a dependency, and the
    automated opensource-license-checker objects to what it sees.  This
    may because of a bug in the checker
    (github.com/datawire/go-mkopensource) that you need to go fix, or it
    may be because of an actual license issue that prevents you from
    being allowed to use a package, and you need to find an alternative.
2 license-detection errors:
 1. package "example.com/gpl": unknown SPDX identifier "GPL-3.0-or-later-with-some-non-standard-exception"
 2. package "github.com/josharian/intern": could not identify a license for all sources (had no global LICENSE file)
    This probably means that you added or upgraded a dependency, and the
    automated opensource-license-checker can't confidently detect what
    the license is.  (This is a good thing, because it is reminding you
    to check the license of libraries before using them.)

    You need to update the
    "github.com/datawire/go-mkopensource/pkg/detectlicense/licenses.go"
    file to correctly detect the license.

    For github.com/josharian/intern in particular, this probably means
    that you are depending on an old version; upgrading to intern
    v1.0.1-0.20211109044230-42b52b674af5 or later should resolve this.
