## Building

You may use `go get github.com/datawire/go-mkopensource`, clone the
repo and run `go build .`, or any of the other usual ways of building
a Go program; there is nothing special about `go-mkopensource`.

## Using as a library

The [`github.com/datawire/go-mkopensource/pkg/detectlicense`][detectlicense]
package is good at detecting the licenses in a file

[detectlicense]: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/datawire/go-mkopensource/pkg/detectlicense

## Design

There are many existing packages to do license detection, such as
[go-license-detector][] or GitHub's [licensee][]. The reason these
are not used is that they are meant to be _informative_, they provide
"best effort" identification of the license.

`go-mkopensource` isn't meant to just be informative, it is meant to
be used for compliance; if it has any reason at all to be even a
little skeptical of a result, rather than returning its best guess, it
asks a human to verify the result.

## License scanning scripts

Folder `/build-aux` contains scripts to scan licenses for Go and
Node.Js. Script will generate both `DEPENDENCY_LICENSES.md` and
`DEPENDENCIES.md`

The following environment variables are used to configure the
application behaviour.

- `APPLICATION`: Required. Name of the application being scanned.
  It's used in the header of the license files.

- `APPLICATION_TYPE`: Required. Where will the application being
  scanned run.
  `internal` is used for anything running on Ambassador Labs servers,
  and `external` for anything that's deployed to customer machines.

- `BUILD_HOME` Required. Location of the root folder of the repo to
  scan.

- `BUILD_TMP`: Required. Folder to use for storing temporary files.

- `GIT_TOKEN` Required. Git token with permissions to pull
  repositories

- `GO_IMAGE` Required. Image to use for generating Go
  dependencies.

- `NPM_PACKAGES`: Optional. List of package.json and package-lock.json
  files to scan. Paths should be relative to `BUILD_HOME`.
  Example:

  `export NPM_PACKAGES="./tools/sandbox/grpc_web/package.json ./tools/sandbox/grpc_web/package-lock.json"`

- `EXCLUDED_PKG`: Optional. Semicolon separated list of npm packages names that we want to exclude for the validation.
  _Important_: it will restrict the output to the packages (package@version) from being reported in DEPENDENCIES.md and DEPENDENCY_LICENSES.md,
  before to use it, confirm if it is absolutely necessary.

  Example:

  `export EXCLUDED_PKG="intro.js@5.0.0;internal-2"`

- `NODE_IMAGE`: Required when `NPM_PACKAGES` is defined. Version
  of Node.JS to use when running npm dependency scan. Only valid
  version numbers (X.Y.Z) are allowed.
  Example:

  `NODE_IMAGE=node:14.13.1-alpine`

- `SCRIPTS_HOME`: Required. Location where `go-mkopensource` repo is
  checked out, relative to `BUILD_HOME`

To update license information files, set the environment variables
described above and run `build-aux/generate.sh`

Tips:

- Add a .dockerignore at the root of your repository and exclude any files that are not necessary for generating depdency
  information, including DEPENDENCIES.md, DEPENDENCY_INFORMATION.md and temporary folders. See the
  [saas_app .dockerignore](https://github.com/datawire/saas_app/blob/master/.dockerignore) for a list of suggested exclussions.

## When scanning fails

The scanner will sometimes fail to detect what kind of licenses a package is using because there's no real standard
stipulating how such files must be organized, and what they must contain. When this happens, and when the failing
package cannot be modified, the scanner must be updated to accommodate the failure. In essence, code must be added
to make the scanner succeed.

Fixing the scanner might take some time, because it's not always self-evident how to do that, or even if it should be
done (the culprit package's owner might be persuaded to fix the problem on their side). Regardless of how the problem
is fixed, it risks blocking progress in projects that use the scanner to produce valid `DEPENDENCIES.md` file.

Blocking progress is never good, and for situations like this, the scanner offers an escape hatch. The `--unparsable-packages`
option. The flag argument is a file name that maps package names to valid SPDX licenses.

Example:
The scanner complains about some package that cannot be parsed:

```
fatal: 2 license-detection errors:
 1. package "sigs.k8s.io/json": could not identify license in file "sigs.k8s.io/json/LICENSE"
 2. package "sigs.k8s.io/json/internal/golang/encoding/json": could not identify license in file "sigs.k8s.io/json/LICENSE"
```

A quick look at the package reveals that it uses an Apache License, but adds extra text at the top of the actual LICENSE
file indicating that it also uses files from golang/encoding/json. We know that golang uses a 3-clause BSD license. So we consult the [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/) to get the canonical
identifiers for the licenses, and add them to an `unparsable-packages.yaml` file to our build system
with the following contents:

```
sigs.k8s.io/json:
  - Apache-2.0
sigs.k8s.io/json/internal/golang/encoding/json:
  - BSD-3-Clause
```

We then use the flag `--unparsable-packages unparsable-packages.yaml` when running `go-mkopensource`.

Example:
In previous versions of this scanner, sometimes the scanner complains about missing dependencies when the scanner gets
the list of all the packages in the file "vendor/modules.txt" using the command "go mod vendor" You can see that in the following output.

```bash
#26 18.21 go: downloading github.com/docker/go-metrics v0.0.0-20180209012529-399ea8c73916
#26 18.24 go: downloading github.com/containerd/cgroups v0.0.0-20200531161412-0dbf7f05ba59
#26 18.28 go: downloading github.com/golang/groupcache v0.0.0-20210331224755-41bb18bfe9da
#26 36.85 github.com/datawire/saas_app/internal/pkg/kubernetes imports
#26 36.85   k8s.io/client-go/rest imports
#26 36.85   k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/clock: no required module provides package k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/clock; to add it:
#26 36.85   go get k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/util/clock
#26 36.85 /scripts/go-mkopensource: fatal: ["go" "mod" "vendor"]: exit status 1
#26 ERROR: executor failed running [/bin/sh -c /scripts/scan-go.sh]: exit code: 1
```

Now the scanner will follow the indications of the "go mod vendor", install the dependencies, and then
get the list of packages from the file ''vendor/modules.txt"

Sometimes it isn't possible to install the dependencies suggested by the "go mod vendor" command.
The scanner will complain with the message "Error installing dependency". In this case the project will require human intervention to solve the problem.

Another reason that may cause a failure is the use of our proprietary packages, like `github.com/datawire/telepresence-pro/rpc/proconnector`.
The error will message will be similar to this one:

```bash
/scripts/go-mkopensource: fatal: 1 license-detection errors:
  1. Package "github.com/datawire/telepresence-pro/rpc/proconnector": could not identify a license for all sources (had no global LICENSE file)
```

To exclude these packages, add a yaml file like this:

```yaml
- github.com/datawire/telepresence-pro/rpc/userdaemon
- github.com/datawire/telepresence-pro/rpc/proconnector
- github.com/datawire/telepresence2-proprietary/rpc/systema
```

And pass it to the generate.sh script using the argument `--proprietary-packages`:

```bash
./generate.sh" --proprietary-packages proprietary-packages.yaml;
```

## Dependabot PRs

When dependabot creates a PR, it's possible that license scanning will fail due so several factors:

1. A Go package is unavailable in the new version of a module
2. Dependency information is out of date.

To reduce friction merging dependabot PRs, there is an action (`save-dependabot-changes`) that will update a PR created by dependabot.

Use the action in a workflow as follows:

```yaml
name: "Verify licenses"
on: push
jobs:
  check_license_info:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: "Generate dependency information"
        run: make generate-dependency-info
      - name: "Save changes made by dependabot"
        id: changed-by-dependabot
        uses: datawire/go-mkopensource/actions/save-dependabot-changes@v0.0.1
        with:
          branches_to_skip: "master"
      - name: Abort if dependencies changed
        if: steps.changed-by-dependabot.outputs.license_information_committed == 'true'
        run: |
          echo "Dependabot triggered a dependency update. Aborting workflow."
          exit 1
      # Continue with other steps
```

**Notes**:

- The GitHub token GITHUB_TOKEN should have at least `contents:write` and `actions: write`
  [privileges](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token).
- The workflow that invokes the action should have a `workflow_dispatch`
  [trigger](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch).

### Testing changes to the `save-dependabot-changes` action

After the action has been updated, you can verify that it works as expected by updating the [smoke tests](.github/workflows/test-action.yml)
to point to the new version of the action.

```yaml
uses: datawire/go-mkopensource/actions/save-dependabot-changes@<VERSION>
```

Note: If you want to test your changes before they are complete, you could use a branch in the action reference, and
update it to a tag once you're ready to release.
